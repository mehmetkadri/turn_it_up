Normal science, the activity in which most scientists always spend literally all their time, is predicated on the assumption that the scientific community knows what the world is like. Some scientists are saying that the success of the enterprise comes from the communityâ€™s willingness to defend that assumption, if necessary at considerable cost. Normal science often suppresses fundamental novelties because they are necessarily subversive of its basic commitments.
