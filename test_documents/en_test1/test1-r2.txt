Electromagnetism is defined as the "force that the electromagnetic field exerts on electrically charged particles," and it is "one of the four fundamental forces.". Electromagnetism and the other three fundamental forces (strong and weak nuclear forces and gravitational force) are the foundations for every other fundamental force, but electromagnetism itself dictates almost every phenomenon we witness daily.
